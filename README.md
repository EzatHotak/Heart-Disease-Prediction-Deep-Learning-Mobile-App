- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Major vessel count
- ...

üì± App Pages
The mobile app includes several screens to guide users and improve the user experience:

üîç How It Works
This page explains how the heart disease prediction system functions:

The user provides clinical inputs such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.

These inputs are passed to a trained deep learning model.

The model then analyzes the data and predicts the likelihood of heart disease.

It also gives clear instructions on what kind of information the user needs to enter for accurate results.

üß™ Predictions
In this section, users input their personal health data into the form fields.

Once submitted, the app runs the data through the TensorFlow Lite model.

The result is displayed instantly, indicating either a low risk or high risk of heart disease.

Visual indicators or messages are used to make the output easy to understand.
